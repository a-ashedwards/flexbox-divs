                <h2>Although you will often find me at the computer, coding and designing, there is more to <em>Amanda Edwards</em> than what you see on the screen.  At first I stumbled upon Web Design, but now I've fallen, head over heels.</h2>

                        <p>Art, aesthetics, and design have always been an important part of my life. I was lucky enough to be introduced to Photoshop and Illustrator while teaching visual art, and wished that my students had access to these tools.   When schools turned to virtual learning in March of 2020, it was time to transition to a new way of teaching and thinking. </p>

                        <p>The time had come to dive into digital art! I was excited to introduce my students to new and innovative ways to utilze their design skills by integrating technology. As I searched for ideas, I came across several sites featuring web design and coding. At first, I was not aware of how much those sites simmered in the back of my mind.</p>

                    <div id="div-3" class="flex-item">
                        
                        <p>Without realizing it, I was suddenly spending hours at my computer, creating layouts and designing lessons.  The time flew, because I was enjoying myself so much.  I was even creating materials for other staff to use, just for fun.  The next time I came across a site about coding, I stopped, read, researched, and signed on.  I haven't regretted it for a moment, either. </p>
