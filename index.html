                Remembering complementary colors can be difficult at first.  If you create this picture in your mind, however, you won't ever forget!  Because complimentary colors are as far away from each other as is possible on the color wheel, they have to shout to be heard.  Imagine Mr. Violet yelling (a compliment) to Miss Yellow ALL the way from across the wheel. "You look simply sunny today Miss Yellow!"

                Analogous colors are the "best friends" of the color world.  We say this, because they are neighbors, all living side-by-side and having many things in common!  This group of best friends is too cool to match their clothes, so they wear the closest colors they can without matching!

                Monochromatic is a word with many letters, unfortunately it does not incorporate many colors. Mono means one.  One color, that's it!  How is someone supposed to create art using only one color? While you may only use one color, however, you may use as many tints and shades of that color as you would like!  This allows for shading and variety while limiting color choices.
